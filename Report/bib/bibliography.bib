abstract = {It’s been more than a year that the entire world is fighting against COVID-19 pandemic. Starting from the Wuhan city in China, COVID-19 has conquered the entire world with its rapid progression. But seeking the importance towards the human situation, it has become essential to build such an automated model to diagnose COVID-19 within less computational time easily. As the disease has spread, there is not enough data to implement an accurate COVID-19 predicting model. But technology is a boon, which makes it possible. Effective techniques based on medical imaging using artificial intelligence have approached to assist humans in needful time. It has become very essential to detect COVID-19 in humans at an early stage to prevent it from becoming more infectious. The neural networks have shown promising results in medical imaging. In this research, a deep learning-based approach is used for image classification to detect COVID-19 using chest X-ray images (CXR). A CNN classifier have been used to classify the normal-healthy images from the COVID-19 images, using transfer learning. The concept of early stopping is used to enhance the accuracy of the proposed DenseNet model. The results of the system have been evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score metrics. An automated comparative analysis among multiple optimizers, LR Scheduler and Loss Function is performed to get the highest accuracy suitable for the proposed system. The Adamax optimizer with Cross Entropy loss function and StepLR scheduler have outperformed with 98.45% accuracy for normal-healthy CXR images and 98.32% accuracy for COVID-19 images.}

abstract = {The remarkable performance of the Transformer architecture in natural language processing has recently also triggered broad interest in Computer Vision. Among other merits, Transformers are witnessed as capable of learning long-range dependencies and spatial correlations, which is a clear advantage over convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been the de facto standard in Computer Vision problems so far. Thus, Transformers have become an integral part of modern medical image analysis. In this review, we provide an encyclopedic review of the applications of Transformers in medical imaging. Specifically, we present a systematic and thorough review of relevant recent Transformer literature for different medical image analysis tasks, including classification, segmentation, detection, registration, synthesis, and clinical report generation. For each of these applications, we investigate the novelty, strengths and weaknesses of the different proposed strategies and develop taxonomies highlighting key properties and contributions. Further, if applicable, we outline current benchmarks on different datasets. Finally, we summarize key challenges and discuss different future research directions. In addition, we have provided cited papers with their corresponding implementations in https://github.com/mindflow-institue/Awesome-Transformer.}
